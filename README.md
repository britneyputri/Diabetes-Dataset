# Diabetes-Dataset

This is my personal project using the diabetes dataset I have found in Kaggle. 

If you are keen to work on the dataset, you can find more information using this link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/akshaydattatraykhare/diabetes-dataset 

### Outline of Dataset
Here is a brief run-through of the data set : 
- There are 8 columns outlining the health and physical conditions of each sample that can be used as the independent variables (i.e. x)
- These 8 columns includes records on Age, Pregnancies, Glucose, Blood Pressure, Skin Thickness, Insulin, BMI, and Diabetes Pedigree Function
- There is 1 Outcome column which takes a value of either 1 or 0

For more information on the predictor variables and outcome variable, you can refer to the source in kaggle. 

### Overview 
Here is a brief overview of the steps when conducting the data analysis in Python: 
1. Checking for null values and anomalies
2. Checking for outliers 
3. Cleaning data and transforming data into the format suitable for modelling
4. Build Logistic regression based on the cleaned data

As the source in Kaggle does not specify how each predictor variable's values are derived, there are a lot of assumptions applied to the model. You can find these assumptions highlighted along the way throughout the Jupyter notebook attached.
